# p5.js Workshop

Welcome to the workshop! This week we will learn how to program with the popular javascript library [**p5.js**](https://p5js.org/ko/). It enables us to easily do creative coding!

We will launch into the world of writing code through the process of programming video games! The emphasis in this workshop is on learning the foundational programming concepts, including variables, conditional statements, and loops, that form the basis of game logic. Students are also exposed to concepts in physics, graphics, and audio libraries while programming the logic for a series of games.

## Learning Outcomes

* Javascript coding basics such as variables, conditionals, iterations, functions and classes
* Basic video game programming concepts, including algorithmic art, character behaviors, sound effects, music, and processing user input
* Game development math such as 2D coordinate systems, vectors, linear equations, and quadratics
* Physics topics such as gravity and forces to model particles
